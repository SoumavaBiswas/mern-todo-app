# First MERN project: A TODO app

This is a simple React-based to-do list application that communicates with a backend API to manage tasks. The original version of the application had an issue where newly added tasks or deleted tasks were not immediately reflected on the UI, requiring a manual browser refresh. This README explains how the issue was resolved to provide real-time updates to the task list.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SoumavaBiswas/mern-todo-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-todo-app`
3. Start the system using Docker Compose: docker-compose up --build -d
4. Access the application: `http://localhost:3000/`

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- RESTful API
- MongoDB
- Docker
